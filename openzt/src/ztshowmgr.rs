//! Stage 1 (struct + constructor + store) of the vanilla `ZTShowMgr` reimplementation - see
//! `openzt/plans/ztshowmgr-implementation-plan.md`. `ZTShowMgr` is the show-scheduling manager: it maps
//! show ids to the `ZTShowInfo` objects habitats register with it (`std::map<unsigned short,
//! ZTShowInfo*>` at `+0x28`), owns the config-loaded trick/show satisfaction thresholds
//! `ZTShow::doTrickEvent`/`calculatePercentAdjustment` read off the live global, and embeds a real
//! `ZTShowScriptMgr` inline at `+0x34` (four of its own methods are pure one-line delegations to that
//! sub-object; `ztshowscriptmgr.rs` already detours the sub-object's own addresses, so those wrappers
//! stay real vanilla code - see the plan's "Composition" section).
//!
//! **Style 2 - fully independent Rust store** (CLAUDE.md's decision criteria): a full decompile-corpus
//! grep (58 files referencing `GLOBAL_ZTShowMgr` outside the class's own, plan appendix) found every
//! external caller reaching the registered-shows map through named accessor methods
//! (`getShowInfo`/`getScript`/`getScriptID`/`registerShow`/`unregisterShow`) and never reading
//! `+0x28`/`+0x2c`/`+0x30` raw - so once those accessors are ported (stages 3+), vanilla's own map
//! becomes safely-inert dead weight that no Rust code below ever reads or writes. That choice also
//! sidesteps this class's one genuine allocator hazard outright: the map's `0x18`-byte nodes come from
//! the shared small-object freelist at `DAT_00638008` (`FUN_00402f85`/`FUN_00405002`/`FUN_00401b16`,
//! none of which has a `generated.rs` entry), a size-class freelist plausibly shared with unrelated
//! 24-byte allocations elsewhere in the game - allocating into it from Rust without the matching free
//! helpers would be exactly CLAUDE.md's cross-allocator corruption class.
//!
//! **The constructor is deliberately never detoured.** Vanilla's own ctor must keep running for the live
//! global (nothing else constructs `GLOBAL_ZTShowMgr`), and under style 2 its real work - taking a
//! freelist node for the map header and running the real config-driven `initShowParams` - is exactly
//! what the live global should keep doing. [`ZTShowMgr::construct`] below is therefore not a detour
//! target: it reproduces the constructor's config-independent writes so standalone instances can be
//! built and compared against the real ctor in the live battery (`ZTSHOWMGR_STANDALONE_ROUNDTRIP`),
//! mirroring `ztsoundscape.rs`'s own `construct`/roundtrip precedent. The one part it deliberately does
//! not reproduce is the freelist allocation itself: a standalone instance's `tree_header` stays null
//! (nothing reimplemented ever reads it - see the style-2 note above), so the test compares the real
//! side's node *shape* but excludes the pointer field itself.
//!
//! **Stage 2** adds the constructor's config-driven half: [`ZTShowMgr::init_show_params`] (the eight
//! `shows.cfg` threshold lookups, gated on expansion pack 2 through real
//! `BFApp::getInstalledExpansion`) detoured via `INIT_SHOW_PARAMS`, so the real, un-detoured
//! constructor's tail-call into it now runs the Rust port. Since the port writes the same defaults
//! vanilla writes and overrides from the same config, the live constructor's end state is unchanged.
//!
//! **Stage 3** makes [`SHOW_STORE`] a *shadow/mirror* of vanilla's tree rather than a replacement
//! (`ztshowmgr-implementation-plan.md`'s "Staging decision" - the read path and write path have to
//! agree on where the data lives, so the first-detoured side must mirror until the read cutover):
//! `registerShow`/`unregisterShow` are detoured, but each detour calls the real vanilla body through
//! its `<NAME>_DETOUR.call` trampoline first - vanilla keeps owning the real tree at `+0x28`, the
//! `DAT_0063e480` id counter, the `field_0x70` id writes, and `clearShowScriptStates` - and only on
//! the real body's success byte mirrors the outcome into [`SHOW_STORE`]. Live-game mutation behavior
//! is therefore exactly vanilla, while the store is a live-verified copy of the real tree. (Stage
//! 9 below has since retired the mirroring itself - the shadow phase's job was to prove the store
//! in sync before anything read it, which five live-green stages on top of the read cutover did.)
//!
//! **Stage 4** flips the read path onto the store: `getShowInfo`/`getScriptID`
//! ([`ZTShowMgr::get_show_info`]/[`ZTShowMgr::get_script_id`]) are detoured and answer every caller -
//! Rust and un-decompiled vanilla alike - out of [`SHOW_STORE`]. Vanilla's own tree is thereby on its
//! way to inert: every external caller the corpus grep found goes through these two addresses
//! (`unregisterShow`'s own internal clear-target lookup included), so the readers always see the
//! in-sync mirror. From here on `GET_SHOW_INFO.original()`/`GET_SCRIPT_ID.original()` are
//! release-profile re-entry hazards like every other hooked address: in-repo call sites that want the
//! live behavior use `.hooked()` (`ztshow.rs`'s `start`, `ztshowui.rs`'s `show_info_for_habitat`), and
//! the battery's real-side poles go through the [`detours`] trampolines. Lock ordering stays safe: the
//! writers take the store's mutex only *after* their trampoline returns, and the readers'
//! mutex critical sections copy-and-unlock without calling out - even though vanilla bodies reached
//! through those trampolines now *do* re-enter the hooked `GET_SHOW_INFO` address internally. The
//! plan's open item - when (and whether) the writers drop their call-through to become full style-2
//! ports - is resolved by stage 9 below; until then the dual-write state was behavior-safe
//! indefinitely while the mirror stayed in sync, which the battery's cross-store oracles asserted
//! after every mutation.
//!
//! **Stage 5** ports the two whole-map walks, `enterNewMonth`/`update`
//! ([`ZTShowMgr::enter_new_month`]/[`ZTShowMgr::update`]), onto the store - the first consumers
//! that iterate *everything* rather than probing one id. They stayed real vanilla through the
//! shadow phase precisely because they walked vanilla's still-authoritative tree; post-cutover the
//! `BTreeMap`'s ascending-`u16` order *is* vanilla's in-order sequence, so both walks become plain
//! iterations calling the same real, untouched `ZTShowInfo` callees vanilla calls (directly for
//! `enterNewMonth`, through the show's own vtable slot `+0x20` for `update`). Neither walk holds
//! [`SHOW_STORE`]'s lock across a callee call: the callees can re-enter the detoured
//! reader/writer addresses (a show's own update can start/stop shows), and the lock is only ever
//! taken to copy the value list out.
//!
//! **Stage 6** ports the save/load pair ([`ZTShowMgr::save`]/[`ZTShowMgr::load`]) - vanilla's thin
//! wrapper around two pieces: the embedded `ZTShowScriptMgr`'s own save/load (already
//! `ztshowscriptmgr.rs`'s Rust store, reached through the same direct `CALL` vanilla makes) and the
//! 2-byte show-id-counter persistence. Those ports landed reading/writing the `DAT_0063e480`
//! global in place because the stage-3 writers still kept their vanilla call-through (the counter
//! was then vanilla-owned); stage 9 has since moved the counter into [`SHOW_STORE`] and repointed
//! both ports at it, making the persisted counter single-owned end to end.
//!
//! **Stage 7** ports `isDoingShow` ([`ZTShowMgr::is_doing_show`]) - the "is this unit performing in
//! that show" probe `ZTUnit::isDoingShow` (`0x00437402`, the corpus's one caller) reaches through.
//! It introduces no new state: it composes the two halves earlier stages put in place, the
//! store-backed `getShowInfo` lookup (stage 4) and a lookup over the found show's embedded
//! `ZTShow`'s script-state map - the same callee `ztshow.rs`'s `do_current_item` already drives.
//! A later review pass ([`crate::ztshow::get_show_script_state`]) replaced that lookup's real,
//! `.hooked()`-routed vanilla call with a pure Rust reader of the same read-only tree - see that
//! function's own doc comment.
//!
//! **Stage 8** ports `isShowScriptDone` ([`ZTShowMgr::is_show_script_done`]) - the last method in
//! the plan's inventory (`ztshowmgr-implementation-plan.md` stage 8), unblocked once a Ghidra regen
//! added its `generated.rs` entry and Windows decompile. Structurally a sibling of stage 7 - same
//! store-backed lookup, same script-state map lookup - differing only in what it does with the
//! found script state: the state pointer is dereferenced for the "done" byte at `+0x13`, which is
//! returned raw. That completed the plan's method inventory.
//!
//! **Stage 9** finishes the style-2 end state: [`ZTShowMgr::register_show`]/[`ZTShowMgr::
//! unregister_show`] drop their `<NAME>_DETOUR.call` call-throughs and become full ports of the
//! real bodies (`ZTShowMgr_registerShow.asm`/`ZTShowMgr_unregisterShow.asm`), and the
//! `DAT_0063e480` show-id counter moves into [`SHOW_STORE`] as a `u16` field (the real increment
//! is a *word* `INC`; the assigned id is `(u16)counter % 0xffff`, so `0xffff` is never assigned
//! and the counter's `0xffff` and wrapped-to-`0` states both yield id `0`). The counter is seeded
//! once from the global at detour-install time ([`init`]); after that the global is inert exactly
//! like vanilla's `+0x28` tree - its three consumers (verified against the full decompile corpus:
//! `registerShow`'s increment, `save`'s write, `load`'s read) are all this module's detoured
//! addresses now, and stage 6's save/load were repointed at the store's field in the same change
//! so the persisted counter never has two owners at any buildable midpoint. The fresh-id write
//! goes through a Rust reimplementation of `ZTShowInfo::setShowInfoID`
//! ([`ZTShowMgr::set_show_info_id`]) - not a plain `field_0x70` store, because the real setter
//! also keeps the embedded `ZTShow`'s `+0x10` back-pointer and `+0x6` id copy in sync. Behavior
//! in-game is unchanged by any of this; the stage exists to retire the permanent store-tree sync
//! obligation of the shadow phase.
