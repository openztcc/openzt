//! Stage 4 (UI consumers) of the vanilla `ZTShowScriptMgr` reimplementation - see
//! `openzt/plans/ztshowscriptmgr-implementation-plan.md`. Stages 1-3 made `ZTShowScriptMgr`/
//! `ZTShowScript`/`ZTShowScriptItem` an independent Rust store and ported every `ZTShow`/`ZTShowInfo`
//! call site that used to raw-dereference that data. This module ports the last two: the show-editor
//! UI panel's `showpanel_fillTrickLists` (populates the "available"/"assigned" trick list boxes) and
//! `_copyListToScript` (the "apply UI selection back to the script" reconciliation handler it calls).
//!
//! Both ported functions also call through to `ZTUI::showpanel::recalcShowStats` (`FUN_00474826` in the
//! Windows decompiles - unnamed there, identified via the macOS decompile and hand-added to
//! `generated.rs` as `ztui_showpanel::RECALC_SHOW_STATS`; see that entry's own comment and
//! [`recalc_show_stats`]'s doc comment), which computes and displays the "Happiness Bonus" number/smiley
//! next to the show-editor's "Tricks in Show" header. An earlier version of this module treated that call
//! as safe to drop entirely (deemed "purely cosmetic-looking"); it is not - since this module's Rust
//! reimplementations replace the *entire* body of the vanilla functions that used to call it, dropping the
//! call meant that display stopped updating altogether (observed live as a stuck `0`).
//!
//! `showpanel_updateAvailableTrickList` (the plan's 3rd originally-flagged UI consumer) needed **no**
//! port and is **not** detoured here: confirmed via a full re-read of its decompile
//! (`private/resources/decompiles/showpanel_updateAvailableTrickList.c`) that every raw dereference it
//! performs is against real, un-touched vanilla memory - `ZTShowMgr::getShowScriptItems`'s own local
//! temporary list (itself a plain deep-copy of `ZTUnitType`'s own real `+0x1ac` trick list, per Stage
//! 3's `getTrickList` finding), `ZTShowInfo::validateTrick`, and UI widget state
//! (`UIListBoxItem::disable`/`field_0x14`). It never touches this crate's independent store.
//!
//! ## Field-offset ground truth
//!
//! All offsets below were cross-checked against `.asm` (not just `.c`) per CLAUDE.md's requirement.
//! Three real, non-obvious findings from that cross-check shape this whole module:
//!
//! 1. **`showpanel_fillTrickLists.c`'s `piVarN[k]` indices are relative to the trick-list *node*, not
//!    the item.** The node is `{next: u32 @+0x0, item: ZTShowScriptItem @+0x8}`, so `piVar7[0x1b]`
//!    (node+0x6c) is `item+0x64` = `normalIcon`, not what a naive item-relative reading would suggest.
//!    Every node-relative index below has already been converted to the item-relative offset it
//!    actually names (confirmed self-consistently: the same four fields - `normalIcon`/`grayedIcon`/
//!    `normalHelpID`/`grayedHelpID` - turn up again as item-relative offsets in `_copyListToScript`'s
//!    `.asm`, this time read directly off an item pointer with no node-vs-item ambiguity at all).
//! 2. **`_copyListToScript.asm`'s "`UIText::setText`" calls are a symbol-misattribution artifact, not
//!    real UI calls.** Each one copy-constructs one of `ZTShowScriptItem`'s six embedded 12-byte SSO
//!    strings (`name`/`anim`/`keeperPreTrick`/`keeperPostTrick`/`normalIcon`/`grayedIcon`) onto the
//!    stack as part of scalarizing a found item into `ZTShowScript::addItem`'s by-value argument -
//!    confirmed by the exact 12-byte-aligned offsets matching the established item field table exactly.
//!    Net effect: the whole "find + scalarize + addItem" sequence in `_copyListToScript` is a
//!    byte-for-byte 124-byte copy of a real item, letting this module read the found item directly as a
//!    [`crate::ztshowscriptmgr::ZTShowScriptItemRaw`] and hand it straight to
//!    [`crate::ztshowscriptmgr::add_item`] instead of hand-mapping 18 fields.
//! 3. **`AI_cls_0x404fd6::meth_0x5a997f`** (called by both `fillTrickLists` and `_copyListToScript` to
//!    resolve a unit type's pending-scripts map entry) returns a pointer whose `+4`/`+6` fields line up
//!    exactly with [`crate::ztshow::find_or_insert_pending_script_node`]'s own node's `+0x1c`
//!    (`current`)/`+0x1e` (`pending`) fields once the base offset (`node+0x18`) is accounted for -
//!    i.e. it is vanilla's own `map::operator[]`-style find-or-insert on the *exact same tree* Stage 2
//!    already reimplemented. Rather than resolve `meth_0x5a997f`'s own address and calling convention
//!    (never found/confirmed - see the plan's Stage 0.2 "hard constraint" list, which never enumerated
//!    it precisely because it wasn't originally recognized as the same tree operation), this module
//!    reuses that existing, live-tested Stage 2 helper directly. This is the "reuse/adapt existing code"
//!    option the handover notes called out as acceptable in place of a real find-only port.
//!
//! ## Deliberately not ported
//!
//! - **`_copyListToScript`'s listbox-not-found teardown branch** (`if (pUStack_c == 0) { if (pZVar11 !=
//!   0) { ZTShowScript::~ZTShowScript(pZVar11); FUN_00402629(pZVar11); } }`) - reached only if the
//!   "assigned tricks" UI element (`0x2b6b`) doesn't exist, which cannot happen while the show-editor
//!   panel that owns this function is even open (the panel's own `init` creates it). Replicating a real
//!   destructor call against a pointer that might be one of this store's synthetic handles would risk
//!   exactly the cross-allocator/invalid-dereference hazard CLAUDE.md warns about, for a branch with no
//!   real-world reachability. This module just returns `0` for that case instead (see
//!   [`copy_list_to_script`]'s own doc comment).
//! - **`ZTShowInfo::validateTrick`'s second half** (a `ZTWorldMgr::getBuildingList` walk gating a
//!   trick's building requirement) is real, un-detoured vanilla code already safe to call through
//!   wherever it's handed a *real* `ZTShowScriptItem*` (both halves of `fillTrickLists`' UI-populate
//!   loop, and `updateAvailableTrickList`, all do exactly this). `fillTrickLists`' second half is the
//!   one exception: vanilla calls it against `ZTShowScript::getItem`'s return value - i.e. an item that
//!   lives in *this crate's* store, which has no real, byte-compatible memory representation to hand a
//!   real vanilla function. This module substitutes the corresponding real item from the unit type's own
//!   `+0x1ac` trick list (found by matching `id`) instead - see [`fill_trick_lists`]'s own doc comment
//!   for why this is a sound substitution (the two copies share the same field values in the common,
//!   non-corrupted case, which is exactly the case this check exists to confirm).
//! - **`addTrick`** (the "Add" button handler moving a selection from "available" to "assigned"; real
//!   name confirmed via macOS's `_addTrick.c` - no Windows `generated.rs` entry exists for it, so it
//!   can't be detoured yet) is left real/un-ported. It only ever reads real vanilla memory this crate
//!   doesn't own (the selected unit type's own trick list via `ZTUnitType::getTrick`,
//!   `ZTShowInfo::validateTrick`, the "assigned" listbox) - **except** one real global vector this
//!   module must keep in sync as a side effect of [`fill_trick_lists`]; see
//!   [`AVAILABLE_TRICK_IDS_BEGIN_RVA`]'s own doc comment for the mechanism and the live crash on "Add"
//!   this fixed.
