//! `ZTSoundscape` reimplementation - the game's crowd/world ambient-audio crossfade state machine, one
//! of `ZTGameMgr`'s pointed-to sub-object classes: `ztgamemgr.rs` holds it as `soundscape_ptr`
//! (`this+0x1190`, explicitly zeroed by `CreateZTGameMgr`) and drives it through this port (`start`
//! allocates + constructs + `init`s it, `update_sim` calls `update`, `stop` runs the destructor + free).
//! See `openzt/plans/ztsoundscape-implementation-plan.md` - this file is the full in-scope port (the two
//! `#[repr(C)]` structs, the pure-write constructor, the [`ZTSoundscape::init`] and
//! [`ZTSoundscape::update`] ports, live-verified by the `ZTSOUNDSCAPE_*` battery tests) plus the
//! [`soundscape_detours`] block hooking the class's three hooked entries (`CONSTRUCTOR`/`INIT`/`UPDATE`),
//! so any caller reaching those addresses runs the Rust code - which is also why `ztgamemgr.rs`'s own
//! three call sites call the Rust methods directly rather than through the addresses. The destructor
//! entry (`generated.rs`'s bare-named `ZTSOUNDSCAPE`) stays deliberately un-detoured (see below), so its
//! call-through in `stop` stays `.original()`.
//!
//! The class has no vtable of its own (confirmed - every vtable dispatch inside its decompiled bodies
//! belongs to an *embedded* `SNDSound` member or a pointed-to `Ambients` object). Its whole method
//! surface is 4 fixed addresses, all already `generated.rs` `ztsoundscape::*` entries: constructor
//! `0x00592596`, `init` `0x005922fd`, `update` `0x004352dd`, and the destructor `0x005003e2` - which
//! the generator filed under the misleadingly bare name `ZTSOUNDSCAPE` (confirmed to actually be the
//! destructor via `ZTSoundscape_~ZTSoundscape.meta`'s matching address; `ztgamemgr.rs` imports it
//! aliased as `ZTSOUNDSCAPE_DESTRUCTOR`).
//!
//! Thin-shell scope boundary: **nothing in the `ambients`/`ambientsgroup`/`sndsound`/`bfsndmgr` modules
//! gets detoured.** `Ambients` stays an out-of-scope class whose construction/play/teardown all run as
//! real vanilla - which also leaves the shared-ownership consumers (`ZTViewingArea` and `ZTHabitat` call
//! `Ambients::play` on their own instances) untouched - and all sound-device interaction runs through
//! the embedded slots' vtables as real vanilla dispatch.
//!
//! Vanilla-layout-compatible (style 1, per `CLAUDE.md`'s two-style split), forced by the teardown: the
//! destructor is deliberately never detoured (straight-line vanilla teardown, no decision logic - the
//! `MenuMusicHandler`/`ZTMegatileMgr`/`ZTAdvTerrainMgr` destructor precedent) and is still called by
//! both `ztgamemgr.rs`'s `stop` and un-ported vanilla `~ZTGameMgr`. It walks the raw fields - stopping
//! the world sound and both crowd slots through the embedded objects' vtables, running `~Ambients` +
//! vanilla `operator delete` on both `Ambients` blocks (behind vanilla's own both-non-null pairing
//! quirk, preserved by not touching it), and swapping the embedded slots' vtables down to
//! `SNDSoundBase`'s - so the fields must at all times hold vanilla-shaped content, which falls out
//! naturally as long as the port constructs everything exactly the way vanilla's own ctor/`init` do.
//!
//! Cross-allocator contract (per `CLAUDE.md`): the `0x54` block and both `0x18` `Ambients` blocks are
//! vanilla `OPERATOR_NEW`/`operator delete` on both sides - the `0x54` block is allocated by
//! `ztgamemgr.rs`'s `start` and freed by `stop` via vanilla `OPERATOR_DELETE` (unchanged by this port),
//! and the `init` port will allocate the two `Ambients` blocks through the same vanilla `OPERATOR_NEW`
//! for *vanilla's* dtor to free. Never a Rust `Box` on vanilla-owned memory.
//!
//! Shared-RNG constraint (`update`'s obligation, landed in stage 3): `update`'s position jitter
//! advances the real global RNG state at VA `0x00638060` through the classic MSVC LCG
//! (`state = state * 0x343fd + 0x269ec3`), 4 chained advances per `Ambients` object, crowd first. The
//! port reads/advances/writes **that exact address** in vanilla's exact advance order - never a
//! Rust-side RNG, or every other vanilla consumer's stream (`BFAIMgr_fRandomWalk`, `ZooStatus_fChance`,
//! `ZTAnimal_*`, `SoundGroup_play`, ...) desyncs.
