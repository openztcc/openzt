//! Structs and methods for the vanilla `ZTThoughtMgr`/`ZTThought` classes, which track the "thought
//! bubble" messages guests/animals display over their heads (e.g. "caught prey", template string id
//! `0x280a`) - a simple, small `BFMgr`-derived class that vanilla implements as a single intrusive,
//! sentinel-terminated linked list of `ZTThought` records.
//!
//! The persistent list itself lives in a plain Rust `VecDeque<ZTThought>`, held in the process-global
//! [`THOUGHT_STORES`] registry keyed by each `ZTThoughtMgr` instance's own `sentinel_ptr` field.
//! `sentinel_ptr` is never repurposed or dereferenced by our own code anymore - it's left exactly as
//! vanilla's `CreateZTThoughtMgr` constructor set it, purely so its value stays a stable, unique
//! per-instance key (real singleton or test standalone alike) without needing a second identity
//! mechanism. All four mutators (`addThought`/`removeThoughtsBy{Thinker,Object,Habitat}`), save/load, and
//! the destructor are detoured onto Rust methods that operate on this store.
//!
//! The three read-only accessors (`getThoughtsBy{Thinker,Object,Habitat}`) are also detoured - see
//! [`thought_accessor_detours`] - but only to log an error if they're ever actually invoked (no known
//! caller reaches them) before falling through to the real vanilla body via `.original()`. That fallback
//! stays safe post-migration specifically *because* `sentinel_ptr` is left untouched: vanilla reads a
//! genuine, permanently self-referencing (i.e. permanently empty) sentinel node, so the fallback can only
//! ever report zero matches, never dereference stale or incompatible memory.
